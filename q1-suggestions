1- A database with TTL feature can be used. TTL allows us to remove the data 
which is older than any given time. Of course this will only be helpful if the old
data is no longer needed.

2-I did not use this in my implementation but django's prefetch_related and 
select_related functions should be used while querying tables with relations.
In this case, while we are accessing the plate numbers there will be no extra
query

3- Using raw sql. Instead of using djangos built-in functions to retrive the data
we can use raw sql query to retrive the data. That way in relational tables we can 
only get the fields of related tables instead of getting every field.
